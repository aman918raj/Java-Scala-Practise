  /*
  A simple function like def double(x: Int) = x*2 can be considered a total function as there is no input x that
  the double() function could not process.However there are some functions that do not support every possible value
  that meets the input type. For example, a function that returns the square root of the input number will not work
  if the input number is negative. Similarly a division function with 0 in denominator isnâ€™t applicable.
  Such functions are called partial functions because they can only partially apply to their input data.
